                    On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                    demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
                    the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
                    duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
                    These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice
                    is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
                    to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
                    or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
                    annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
                    selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid
                    worse pains
